## Making Eclipse aware of fresh dependencies in a SBT project
While eclipsifying a SBT project in order to open the project in Eclipse IDE all the library dependencies specified in the `build.sbt` are downloaded and registered in the generated eclipse `.classpath` file.

However every time you add new library dependencies in `build.sbt` it requires re-eclipsification of the SBT project i.e., you would need to re-run `sbt eclipse` so that freshly downloaded dependencies are also registered in `.classpath` file.

## Debug Lagom Projects
To debug lagom projects, start `sbt` in debug mode like so, `sbt -jvm-debug 5005` and then add a remote debug configuration in your intellij project before launching the same.

## Using SBT from behind proxy
In order to use SBT behind proxy server you need to set an *environment variable* named "**SBT_OPTS**" with following value.

``` 
-Dhttps.proxyHost=proxyserver -Dhttp.proxyPort=proxyserverport -Dhttp.proxyUser=username -Dhttp.proxyPassword=password
```
